## WATer DetEKtion with Sentinel-1-Time-Series

This module aims to detect surface water bodies and their temporally fluctuating water extent over a series of time.
It was outsourced as an extra functionality of the BanDiTS module developed by MÃ¼ller & Ziemer, which aims to detect breakpoints and land cover changes over time.
